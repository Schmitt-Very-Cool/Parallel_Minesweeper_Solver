# Parallel_Minesweeper_Solver
A program that generates a minesweeper puzzle and then solves it by offloading the work onto multiple client computers. Made for Doug Lea's Parallel Programming class.

Find the JAR files in out/artifacts if you just want to run it.

Run by running the Server (ParallelGameSolver) first, then clients (MinesweeperOffloadedWorker), then click start. The actual Minesweeper algorithm could use some work.
