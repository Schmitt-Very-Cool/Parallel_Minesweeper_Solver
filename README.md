# Parallel_Minesweeper_Solver
A program that generates a minesweeper puzzle and then solves it by offloading the work onto multiple client computers. Made for Doug Lea's Parallel Programming class.

Run by running the Server first, then clients, then click start. The actual Minesweeper algorithm could use some work.
